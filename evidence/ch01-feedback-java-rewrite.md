# Challenge 1 Copilot-rewrite Java arm feedback

## Scope and provenance

- Path: `copilot-rewrite`, Java/PostgreSQL slice
- Immutable workshop baseline: `4bf59f7ee8dae11259d73ba5a5d7cb0e3355c4af`
- Execution host: macOS laptop, no-deploy arm (not the provisioned Windows VM)
- Checkpoints 1–4 executed locally; checkpoints 5–8 inspected only
- Azure boundary: no `az`, `azd`, `az acr build`, deployment, migration, role assignment,
  or cleanup was attempted at any point.

This file was produced late. It was a deliverable of the original brief and was missed
through two close-outs; it exists because a completeness poll asked what had never been
delivered. That omission is recorded here rather than quietly repaired.

## Timings

**Per-step timings were requested by the brief and were not captured.** No instrumentation
was added at the time and the durations cannot now be reconstructed without inventing them,
so none are reported. Only these anchors are real:

| Anchor | Timestamp (UTC) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checkpoint 1 native suite complete, 34 tests | 2026-08-27T21:51:32Z | `evidence/surefire-reports` mtime |
| Runbook fixes committed | 2026-08-28T02:13:12Z | `383b9f7`, `5393507` |
| Regressed fixes restored after rebase | 2026-08-28T02:15:05Z | `d0420e2` |
| JDK guidance retracted | 2026-08-28T13:41:29Z | `1fa80cf` |
| Evidence committed | 2026-08-28T14:07:29Z | `216433e` |

The only durations measured at all are test-runner self-reports: the Java suite at 25.6 s
and the acceptance suite at 53–60 s across runs.

## What was executed, and how honestly

- **Checkpoint 1** — Java suite **34 passed**, including `PostgreSqlIntegrationTest`, which
  the VM-based Java track excluded. Docker 27.4 was present locally.
- **Frozen contract surface — 14/14 `Contract.*` display names green**, matching the bar the
  Java modernization track reached. The rewrite path can reach the same frozen surface.
- **Acceptance harness — 612 passed, 1 skipped.** This green is qualified below.
- **`catalog_acceptance --profile full`** was run locally, not `smoke`.
- **Checkpoint 4** — a candidate Dockerfile was authored, which is what demonstrated the
  blocking finding below. It was never committed; it exists only in session state.

**The checkpoint-1 fenced block was never executed as a block.** It opens with
`set -euo pipefail` and gates on `code --list-extensions` at
`solutions/ch01-copilot-rewrite/java/README.md:76`. The VS Code CLI is absent on this host,
so the block aborts before reaching Maven. The constituent commands were run individually.
"Executed for real" therefore means the commands inside the block ran; the block did not.

## Unsatisfied gates

1. **The rewrite path cannot keep the shared static suite green.**
   `MODERNIZATION_SURFACE` is derived from the *modernization* diff, freezing 42 of 50 Java
   sources and leaving 1 of 5 suggested slices legal. `MODERNIZATION_ADDITIONS["java"]`
   contains `Dockerfile`, so performing checkpoint 4 breaks the assertion **with both
   diagnostics printing an empty list**, giving a participant no way to read the cause.
   The 612-passed run above is green **only because `--deselect` suppresses that guard.**

   **Disposition — remedied upstream after this file was written.** As raised, this gate was
   described as unsatisfiable and the deselect as "a mitigation, not a fix". That judgement
   was accurate at the rev it was written against and is superseded at
   `origin/rewrite-integration`. Commit `ff70fac` reclassifies
   `test_reference_tree_differs_from_legacy_only_where_the_workshop_teaches` as a
   **repository-authoring guard rather than a participant gate** — a participant who authors
   the Dockerfile checkpoint 4 asks for puts the name on both sides of the comparison, so
   "nothing is undeclared and nothing is missing; the participant simply did their homework."
   The deselect is therefore the correct answer, not a workaround, and
   `test_rewrite_runbooks_deselect_the_reference_tree_authoring_guard` now *requires* both
   rewrite runbooks to carry it (2 invocations each) while the modernization runbooks keep
   running the guard in full.

   **This arm did not detect that.** `MODERNIZATION_ADDITIONS` is byte-identical at both
   revs, so re-reading the constant reports "unchanged, still open" whether or not the
   finding was closed — the remedy was a reclassification plus a runbook requirement, and
   neither is visible in the substrate the symptom lives in. Recorded as an instance of
   mechanism E in `docs/CommonErrors.md`.
2. **The extension preflight gate at `:76`** is unsatisfiable without the VS Code CLI and was
   bypassed, not met.
3. **No handoff instance was produced.** Checkpoint 8 was inspect-only, so the handoff
   contract was never exercised end-to-end from this path.

## Ambiguities a participant hits

1. **The Dockerfile location is stated wrongly and the wrong term is *defined*.** The
   challenge directs the Dockerfile "at the repository root" while the frozen registry pins
   `java/Dockerfile`, and the challenge separately defines "the repository root" as
   `C:\MicroHack\source`. A participant following the instruction lands the file one
   directory above the registry pin, above the contract test that reads it, and above
   `az acr build`. Four documents carried the claim, not one.
2. **Checkpoint numbering diverges between challenge and runbook, with no crosswalk.** Eight
   numbered checkpoints against six runbook sections, and the same sentence appears as
   "the image itself is built in checkpoint 7" and "…in section 5".
3. **Slice 5 refers to "the existing non-root container image"** at a point in the ordering
   where the baseline deliberately ships no Dockerfile and checkpoint 4 has not yet authored
   one. The artifact does not exist under any reading.
4. **`--profile smoke` at `:160` is the only profile invocation in the entire Java runbook.**
   Smoke skips checks that full performs and still prints `passed`, so a participant
   following the runbook literally cannot reach the stronger profile. This arm ran full, and
   did so by deviation rather than by instruction.
5. **Machine-produced test output cannot travel.** `java/.gitignore:1` excludes `target/`, so
   surefire's default output at `java/target/surefire-reports/` is silently uncommittable.
   The runbook copies it to `.workshop-tmp/`, a temporary directory, and never to
   `evidence/`. Producing the evidence artifact required a hand-copy the material does not
   describe.
6. **The handoff schema enumerates `copilot-rewrite-java`, but no `copilot-rewrite` instance
   ships anywhere in the tree.** The single shipped example declares
   `path = copilot-modernization`, and it cannot validate in the location it ships in,
   because the validator folds the handoff's own repo-relative path into the required
   evidence set while the registry pins a different filename.
7. **Prerequisite recovery off the VM is documented, but described as something else where
   it is linked.** The answers exist as `docs/CommonErrors.md` entries 45 and 101. Every
   challenge README routes troubleshooting to `docs/Troubleshooting.md` (12 links), which
   never mentions `javac`, a JDK or a JRE, and nothing under `challenges/` references the
   error registry at all (0 references). One hop does exist —
   `docs/Troubleshooting.md:211`, the last content line of a 212-line file — but it calls
   the registry *"resolved implementation pitfalls"*, which reads as historical-internal
   rather than as answers to errors you are about to hit, and the next sentence attaches a
   caveat discouraging the use it just enabled. This arm originally filed this as
   *unreachable*; that was an overreach, corrected to the measured scope above.

## Reliability observation

Readiness cannot detect schema loss. `HealthController.java:49-55` implements
`databaseReady()` as `SELECT 1`, which succeeds whenever a connection opens, regardless of
whether the schema the application requires is present. The .NET stack has the identical
shape via `CanConnectAsync`. A replica whose table has been dropped therefore reports ready,
keeps receiving traffic, serves 500s, and is never restarted by the platform. This was later
observed live on the deployed environment — `/healthz` 200, `/readyz` 200, `/` 500 — in a
state that had persisted for over a day. Challenges 4 and 5 teach attendees to detect silent
failure, and the reference application ships the exact silent-failure shape those chapters
are about.

## Corrections this arm made to its own work

Five corrections were made to this arm's own filings. Two were surfaced by the facilitator
declining to take the arm's word; three the arm found by re-checking claims it had already
made. Listed in the order they happened:

1. **"The non-VM prerequisite path is unstated."** Refuted — `docs/CommonErrors.md` entry
   101 names this exact symptom, cause and resolution. This arm had invented a Homebrew
   route the material never mentions, hit its failure, and filed that as a workshop defect.
   The invented route was then *shipped* into `java/README.md` and the error registry.
   Withdrawn; retracted at `1fa80cf`.
2. **"Four environment variables are undocumented."** Refuted by the facilitator — all four
   are documented in one table, four rows below where the search stopped.
3. **The retraction in (1) was itself an overreach**, corrected at `8033b29`. It read entry
   101's *"do not install an unpinned JDK"* as forbidding host installs, and on that basis
   **deleted** the registry's only answer to a real failure — the Homebrew cask aborting in
   a non-TTY shell — while asserting in two files that a tarball or cask "is the wrong
   answer even when it appears to work". The registry makes no such prohibition: that
   sentence sits in a container-build context where *unpinned* means *not digest-pinned*.
   Three attempts to salvage the claim all failed. The entry was restored verbatim.
4. **"The error registry is unreachable from the participant path."** Corrected to measured
   scope. One hop does exist (`docs/Troubleshooting.md:211`). The cited evidence was a search
   for `javac|JDK|JRE`, which correctly establishes that the file does not discuss JDKs and
   was then used to claim it does not *link the registry* — a different question.
5. **A residue of (3) survived into this file** and into a second document after the claim
   had been retracted once. Found by re-reading rather than by anyone asking.

Two further self-catches concerned the write-up rather than the findings: a commit that
recorded the rule below but not the corollary it was derived from, caught by grepping the
commit for the thing it was believed to contain and finding nothing.

The shape these share is the most transferable thing this arm produced, and it is recorded
durably in `docs/CommonErrors.md` rather than only in correspondence:

> **A claim that the material is silent on X may not rest on a filtered search.** The
> original form: the filter could not have returned the counter-evidence. The sharper form,
> which covers a filter that is perfectly well built but answers a different question than
> the conclusion needs: **search for the thing being denied, not the subject matter around
> it.** Two corollaries, each learned by violating it — *counting a filter's hits is not
> reading them*, and *a non-zero exit is not a zero result*, since a broken query and a real
> negative both print nothing.

The property worth carrying forward is where these failures occurred. **Every one of them
arose in the verification step, not the discovery step.** Nothing here was found carelessly;
it was *confirmed* carelessly. Confirmation is where the effort feels already spent, which is
exactly why it is under-defended.

## Not measured — do not infer from this arm

Any Azure deployment, ACR build, migration checkpoint, cloud telemetry, public-IP tenant
restriction, release stage, or handoff instance. The five-slice rewrite loop was not run end
to end; one slice's shape was exercised. The full acceptance profile was run locally only,
never against a deployed application.

**Screenshots: none exist.** No image artifact was captured at any point by this arm.
