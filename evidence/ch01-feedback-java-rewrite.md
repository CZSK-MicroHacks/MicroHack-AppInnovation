# Challenge 1 Copilot-rewrite Java arm feedback

## Scope and provenance

- Path: `copilot-rewrite`, Java/PostgreSQL slice
- Immutable workshop baseline: `4bf59f7ee8dae11259d73ba5a5d7cb0e3355c4af`
- Execution host: macOS laptop, no-deploy arm (not the provisioned Windows VM)
- Checkpoints 1–4 executed locally; checkpoints 5–8 inspected only
- Azure boundary: no `az`, `azd`, `az acr build`, deployment, migration, role assignment,
  or cleanup was attempted at any point.

This file was produced late. It was a deliverable of the original brief and was missed
through two close-outs; it exists because a completeness poll asked what had never been
delivered. That omission is recorded here rather than quietly repaired.

## Timings

**Per-step timings were requested by the brief and were not captured.** No instrumentation
was added at the time and the durations cannot now be reconstructed without inventing them,
so none are reported. Only these anchors are real:

| Anchor | Timestamp (UTC) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checkpoint 1 native suite complete, 34 tests | 2026-08-27T21:51:32Z | `evidence/surefire-reports` mtime |
| Runbook fixes committed | 2026-08-28T02:13:12Z | `383b9f7`, `5393507` |
| Regressed fixes restored after rebase | 2026-08-28T02:15:05Z | `d0420e2` |
| JDK guidance retracted | 2026-08-28T13:41:29Z | `1fa80cf` |
| Evidence committed | 2026-08-28T14:07:29Z | `216433e` |

The only durations measured at all are test-runner self-reports: the Java suite at 25.6 s
and the acceptance suite at 53–60 s across runs.

## What was executed, and how honestly

- **Checkpoint 1** — Java suite **34 passed**, including `PostgreSqlIntegrationTest`, which
  the VM-based Java track excluded. Docker 27.4 was present locally.
- **Frozen contract surface — 14/14 `Contract.*` display names green**, matching the bar the
  Java modernization track reached. The rewrite path can reach the same frozen surface.
- **Acceptance harness — 612 passed, 1 skipped.** This green is qualified below.
- **`catalog_acceptance --profile full`** was run locally, not `smoke`.
- **Checkpoint 4** — a candidate Dockerfile was authored, which is what demonstrated the
  blocking finding below. It was never committed; it exists only in session state.

**The checkpoint-1 fenced block was never executed as a block.** It opens with
`set -euo pipefail` and gates on `code --list-extensions` at
`solutions/ch01-copilot-rewrite/java/README.md:76`. The VS Code CLI is absent on this host,
so the block aborts before reaching Maven. The constituent commands were run individually.
"Executed for real" therefore means the commands inside the block ran; the block did not.

## Unsatisfied gates

1. **The rewrite path cannot keep the shared static suite green.**
   `MODERNIZATION_SURFACE` is derived from the *modernization* diff, freezing 42 of 50 Java
   sources and leaving 1 of 5 suggested slices legal. `MODERNIZATION_ADDITIONS["java"]`
   contains `Dockerfile`, so performing checkpoint 4 breaks the assertion **with both
   diagnostics printing an empty list**, giving a participant no way to read the cause.
   The 612-passed run above is green **only because `--deselect` suppresses that guard.**
   This is a mitigation, not a fix, and the gate remains unsatisfiable from this path.
2. **The extension preflight gate at `:76`** is unsatisfiable without the VS Code CLI and was
   bypassed, not met.
3. **No handoff instance was produced.** Checkpoint 8 was inspect-only, so the handoff
   contract was never exercised end-to-end from this path.

## Ambiguities a participant hits

1. **The Dockerfile location is stated wrongly and the wrong term is *defined*.** The
   challenge directs the Dockerfile "at the repository root" while the frozen registry pins
   `java/Dockerfile`, and the challenge separately defines "the repository root" as
   `C:\MicroHack\source`. A participant following the instruction lands the file one
   directory above the registry pin, above the contract test that reads it, and above
   `az acr build`. Four documents carried the claim, not one.
2. **Checkpoint numbering diverges between challenge and runbook, with no crosswalk.** Eight
   numbered checkpoints against six runbook sections, and the same sentence appears as
   "the image itself is built in checkpoint 7" and "…in section 5".
3. **Slice 5 refers to "the existing non-root container image"** at a point in the ordering
   where the baseline deliberately ships no Dockerfile and checkpoint 4 has not yet authored
   one. The artifact does not exist under any reading.
4. **`--profile smoke` at `:160` is the only profile invocation in the entire Java runbook.**
   Smoke skips checks that full performs and still prints `passed`, so a participant
   following the runbook literally cannot reach the stronger profile. This arm ran full, and
   did so by deviation rather than by instruction.
5. **Machine-produced test output cannot travel.** `java/.gitignore:1` excludes `target/`, so
   surefire's default output at `java/target/surefire-reports/` is silently uncommittable.
   The runbook copies it to `.workshop-tmp/`, a temporary directory, and never to
   `evidence/`. Producing the evidence artifact required a hand-copy the material does not
   describe.
6. **The handoff schema enumerates `copilot-rewrite-java`, but no `copilot-rewrite` instance
   ships anywhere in the tree.** The single shipped example declares
   `path = copilot-modernization`, and it cannot validate in the location it ships in,
   because the validator folds the handoff's own repo-relative path into the required
   evidence set while the registry pins a different filename.
7. **Prerequisite recovery off the VM is documented but unroutable.** The answers exist as
   `docs/CommonErrors.md` entries 45 and 101, but every challenge README routes
   troubleshooting to `docs/Troubleshooting.md`, which never mentions `javac`, a JDK or a
   JRE, and nothing under `challenges/` references the error registry at all.

## Reliability observation

Readiness cannot detect schema loss. `HealthController.java:49-55` implements
`databaseReady()` as `SELECT 1`, which succeeds whenever a connection opens, regardless of
whether the schema the application requires is present. The .NET stack has the identical
shape via `CanConnectAsync`. A replica whose table has been dropped therefore reports ready,
keeps receiving traffic, serves 500s, and is never restarted by the platform. This was later
observed live on the deployed environment — `/healthz` 200, `/readyz` 200, `/` 500 — in a
state that had persisted for over a day. Challenges 4 and 5 teach attendees to detect silent
failure, and the reference application ships the exact silent-failure shape those chapters
are about.

## Corrections this arm made to its own work

Two claims filed by this arm were withdrawn after checking rather than defending them:

- A claim that four environment variables were undocumented. They are documented, in one
  table, four rows below where the search stopped.
- A claim that the non-VM prerequisite path was unstated. It is stated, in
  `docs/CommonErrors.md` entry 101 — which names this exact symptom, cause and resolution,
  and explicitly forbids installing an unpinned JDK. This arm had invented a Homebrew route
  the material never mentions, hit its failure, and filed that as a workshop defect. The
  invented route was then *shipped* into `java/README.md` and the error registry, leaving two
  contradictory resolutions for one root cause in a single file. Retracted at `1fa80cf`.

Both failures share one shape and it is the most transferable thing this arm produced:
**a claim that the material is silent on something is inadmissible when its evidence is a
filtered search, because the filter could not have returned the counter-evidence.** The
second failure adds a variant — the answer existed in a file that was never searched at all,
because the search was scoped to the document being executed.

## Not measured — do not infer from this arm

Any Azure deployment, ACR build, migration checkpoint, cloud telemetry, public-IP tenant
restriction, release stage, or handoff instance. The five-slice rewrite loop was not run end
to end; one slice's shape was exercised. The full acceptance profile was run locally only,
never against a deployed application.

**Screenshots: none exist.** No image artifact was captured at any point by this arm.
